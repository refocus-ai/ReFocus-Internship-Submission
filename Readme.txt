This is a ReFocus Time Savings Calculator User Stories

This program takes the input from the users which involves number of employees/staff
the company has. It further takes ask for Producers, Administrators, and Account Executive out of those employees.
It contains a slider to set number of clients the agency has, As check a checkbox about whether the company uses an Agency
Management System.A input box asking for how often a user speaks to underwriters for which I have used radio. And at last, number of carriers that a user reach out to in order to get a policy written.

In the end it calculates the value of X and Y using javascript functions calculate(), withAMS() and withoutAMS().


If the user leaves the input entry empty, then a message will pop up. 
Also, I have added some error testing like if the total number of users input is less than the sum of producers, admins and executives then it will pop up a message.
Also if user input value less than 0 then it will pop up a message.

I have used animations, bootstrap 4.0 framework, my own css and HTML coding to style and give a decent look to this mini application.

Along with that, I have used flex box to keep this mini application responsive and running. 

I have used ReFocus logo image from their website for my mini Refocus Time Saving calculator mini application's landing page


/*-----Unit Testing---*/

I have also made 4 unit tests to test my javascript code in order to test the calculation with or without AMS.
